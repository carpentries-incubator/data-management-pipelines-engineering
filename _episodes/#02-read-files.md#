Time series data are often stored at intervals as files. In order to analyze the complete time series, it's necessary to combine these files. This can present challenges as the instruments used to record the data may change over time, resulting in the use of different layouts and column headers across time to describe the same types of measurements.

## Libraries

When you launch a Python environment, it opens with a set of default libraries loaded. These libraries provide access to a default set of functions, including commonly used functions like ```print``` and ```help```. Libraries can be used to extend the functionality of the environment beyond the default.

About Pandas...

About glob


~~~
import pandas as pd
import glob
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Reading files

~~~
data = pd.read_csv("0_power_consumption_subset.txt")
~~~
{: .language-python}


## Inspecting the data

The data is assigned to the variable ```data```, which is an object.

Get information about ```data``` as an object, and also information about the data.

~~~
# Find the data type of the 'data' object

print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
~~~
{: .output}

We can get information about the data by requesting its attributes or using functions.

Use the ```shape`` attribute to see the size in rows and columns.

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
